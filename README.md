# Trend-Analysis-and-Future-Prediction-of-Milk-Production-in-Turkiye-on-R-Programme

This study aims to demonstrate the utilization of the R programming environment for conducting trend analysis, seasonal patterns, and predicting future milk production, providing insights for sustainable production and policy implications. Although various statistical software can be used for predicting, the R offers greater flexibility, powerful visualization tools, and the added advantage of being freely accessible. Monthly time series data from TÜİK covering the period 2010-2023 is employed for milk production trend analysis and future period predicting. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope test are applied to examine production trends after ensuring data stationarity. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are employed to predict future milk production. Model fitness is assessed, and the results of the analyses are reported. R codes are provided for generating HTML, and Rmd files to present the results. Researchers can customize these R codes to adapt the particularities of their own datasets.
